# Water Quality Classification

Implemented an artificial neural network using the backpropagation algorithm from scratch to classify water quality. Conducted a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insight into the dataset characteristics and optimize model performance. Employed an over-sampling method using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to ensure a balanced representation of diverse water quality parameters in the training data and used the Random Undersampler method for the test data.
